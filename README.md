# ch5_baxley_calendar

Challenge 5 Calendar

## Description

This project was the creation of a simple Task-tracking Calendar that utilized day.js and jQuery to provide specific aspects to the Java script to make the page interactive. (https://kaneknah.github.io/ch5_baxley_calendar/). The website was created using starter code for CSS, HTML, and Java Script. I added multiple sets of code to connect unique jQuerry aspects, such as event listeners, add text features, local storage storing and retrieving and adding classes to specific elements. Day.js was utilized for creation of an active calendar as well as setting the task rows to change color based on the time of day.

When all API code and aspects were correctly codded, the Webpage should allow users to imput a task and save it. The task row will change color live as the time of the day progresses, allowing users to see what tasks are current, in the past, or still in the furutre.

This project was a less challenging than previous projects as the strugle was mainly finding the right jQuery code to help implement what was needed into the starter JS. However, syntax and understanding how this code interacts with the rest of the code, is a learning aspect that I was happy to get practice with, but still require more time to master.

## Installation

No Instalation Steps

## Usage

This project can be initiated typing a Task into the writable portion of each row and clicking the button on the left to save that information to the local storage. The Task will remain on the page even after refreshing. The Tasks will update color in real time to indicate Tasks that are pressent, current, or past based on the time of the day.
